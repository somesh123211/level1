## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Copy `env_example.txt` to `.env` and configure:
- MongoDB connection string
- SendGrid API credentials
- OpenAI API key
- Redis connection (optional)
- Secret key for Flask sessions

### 3. Database Setup
The application will automatically create the following MongoDB collections:
- `students` - Student profiles
- `quizzes` - Quiz questions and templates
- `assessments` - Assessment submissions
- `performance` - Performance tracking data
- `certificates` - Generated certificates
- `forums` - Forum posts and discussions
- `challenges` - Peer challenges
- `leaderboard` - Leaderboard data
- `ai_models` - AI model configurations
- `plagiarism_logs` - Cheating detection logs

### 4. AI Model Setup
- The application uses pre-trained models for sentiment analysis and text classification
- OpenAI API is used for advanced NLP tasks
- Scikit-learn models are trained on-the-fly for adaptive learning

## üîß Configuration Options

### AI Model Settings
```python
# In app.py, you can modify:
AI_MODEL_CACHE_SIZE = 1000  # Cache size for AI models
AI_MODEL_UPDATE_INTERVAL = 3600  # Model update interval in seconds
```

### Cheating Detection Sensitivity
```python
# Adjust thresholds in check_suspicious_activity function:
TAB_SWITCH_THRESHOLD = 15  # Maximum allowed tab switches
MIN_ANSWER_TIME = 5  # Minimum time per question in seconds
```

### Adaptive Learning Parameters
```python
# Modify difficulty adjustment in predict_difficulty:
DIFFICULTY_ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR = 0.2  # How much to adjust difficulty
PERFORMANCE_WINDOW = 5  # Number of recent assessments to consider
```

## üìä Usage Examples

### Start a Company Quiz
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/quizzes/company/tcs?type=aptitude&difficulty=0.7"
```
